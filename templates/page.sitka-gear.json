All of the patterns have been scientifically engineered and proven to achieve this.<\/p><p>There is no finer hunting clothing available than Sitka. Every piece in their lineup has been carefully chosen and designed so there is no overlap between products. Sitka makes products designed as a layering system that you can build off of.
